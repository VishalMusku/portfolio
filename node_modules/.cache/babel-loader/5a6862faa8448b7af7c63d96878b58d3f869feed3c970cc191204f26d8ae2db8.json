My project aimed to analyze health indicators to identify the key predictors of diabetes and improve early detection and prevention strategies. ObjectiveTo identify and model significant risk factors for diabetes using data analysis techniques, ultimately developing a simplified yet effective predictive model. DatasetThe project utilized the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), comprising 70,692 survey responses with 21 independent variables. Methodology 1. Data Cleaning: Removed subjective variables to focus on more objective indicators. 2. Regression Analysis: Performed linear and logistic regression to establish baseline accuracy. Logistic regression achieved 73.38% accuracy in predicting diabetes. 3. Decision Tree Analysis: Built decision tree models using Python (sklearn) and Weka. Identified key predictors such as cholesterol checks, high blood pressure, and BMI. Accuracy ranged from 71.52% to 72.52%. 4. Association Rules: Applied association rules to find significant relationships between diabetes and variables like healthcare access and age. 5. Cluster Analysis: Used K-means clustering to group variables and identify top predictors, achieving 68.31% accuracy. Key Findings * Top Predictors: High blood pressure, cholesterol check, vegetable consumption, and high cholesterol were consistently identified as significant predictors of diabetes. * Simplified Model: A 4-variable model maintained near-equal accuracy (69.12%) with reduced complexity, making it more practical for implementation. ImpactThe findings emphasize the importance of regular screenings for cholesterol and blood pressure and maintaining a healthy diet. The project demonstrates how data analysis can provide actionable insights for improving public health. Technologies Used * Tools: Python (sklearn, statsmodel), Weka, Excel * Techniques: Regression, Decision Trees, Association Rules, Cluster Analysis OutcomeThe project successfully identified critical health indicators for diabetes, offering a streamlined model for practical use in preventive healthcare and educational initiatives.\"]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 7,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 5,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n};\n_c = Project1;\nexport default Project1;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Project1\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","Project1","className","children","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["/Users/vishalreddy/Desktop/vishalp/portfolio_website/src/views/Project1.jsx"],"sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\n\nconst Project1 = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto p-4\">\n      <h1 className=\"text-4xl font-bold\">Project 1</h1>\n      <p className=\"mt-4\">\n\n        <h2>Description: </h2>\n        \n        Diabetes Classification Project\n\nProject OverviewDiabetes is a prevalent chronic condition characterized by impaired glucose regulation.
